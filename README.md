# Password-checker-project.-Student-Iudina-Anastasiia.-Student-ID-35486334
A description of my project, a file with each code, and a link to the video


Steps of my Cloud project:
1 step: Create a password-checker folder and navigate to it
 
2 step: Create: index.html – the main page of the website; styles.css – styles for the design; script.js – the logic of password verification; server.js – server on Node.js; public/ - a folder for static files; src/ - a folder for future server files.
 
3 step: Install Node.js and server creation:
Creating a package package.json with the project settings.
Installing Express is a lightweight framework for creating a server on Node.js.
Writing the server code in server.js: This code creates a server, opens access to files from the public folder, and starts the server on port 3000. (available here in Github in file - server.js)
