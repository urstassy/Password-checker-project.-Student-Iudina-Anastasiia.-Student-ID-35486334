# Password-checker-project.-Student-Iudina-Anastasiia.-Student-ID-35486334
A description of my project, a file with each code, and a link to the video


Steps of my Cloud project:

Step 1: 
Create a password-checker folder and navigate to it
 
Step 2: 
Create: index.html – the main page of the website; styles.css – styles for the design; script.js – the logic of password verification; server.js – server on Node.js; public/ - a folder for static files; src/ - a folder for future server files.
 
Step 3: 
Install Node.js and server creation:
Creating a package package.json with the project settings.
Installing Express is a lightweight framework for creating a server on Node.js.
Writing the server code in server.js: This code creates a server, opens access to files from the public folder, and starts the server on port 3000. (available here in Github in file - server.js)

Step 4:
Creating a web interface
We are creating a simple web page where the user can enter a password and get an assessment of its strength.
Writing the code to a file index.html (available here in Github in file - index.html)

Step 5:
Creating a styles.css file
Creating a file with styles to improve the appearance of the page.
Writing the code to the styles.css file (available here in Github in file - styles.css)
This code: aligns the content to the centre of the screen, adds a beautiful shadow and rounded corners, gives style to the input field and text, a gradient background (purple transition), a translucent container with a blur effect, an animated input field, beautiful styles for weak, medium and strong passwords.

Step 6:
Adding a script.js file
Writing a code that will analyse the password and display its strength.
Code: monitors the password entry, checks the length and the presence of numbers and letters of different cases and characters, displays a message (Too short, Weak, Medium, Strong), and changes the colour of the block depending on the strength of the password.
